# Things to do
There are a lot of them, so here's a list.

## Research
* Look for ways that player's spybot selection affects gameplay (it appears not
  to, but some game internals suggest that Gamelab might have at some point
  intended for spybots to have attacks like databattle units do)
* Document where and how sectors are added to units when healing attacks (from
  units like Data Doctor) are inflicted on them
* Can special (non-damage) attacks be executed on non-passable cells?  We know
  that damage attacks never can be.
*

## Design
* Keep the top UI bar?  It partially obscures the top row of cells.
* Keep the spybot selection screen if we determine that spybot selection does
  not impact gameplay?


## Implementation
